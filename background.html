<p>Formula One is the highest class of international racing. The premise is simple. 10 teams and 20 drivers race around 23 tracks across the world. Points are awarded to the top 10 with first place receiving 25 points and those behind collecting incrementally lower amounts. Race weekends traditionally begin with practice on Fridays, qualifying on Saturdays and topped off with the main event, a Grand Prix, on Sundays.</p>
